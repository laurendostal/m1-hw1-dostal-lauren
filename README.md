## About Me

Hello! My names Lauren and I live in Florida.  Some of my favorite activities include watching movies, running, making digital art, and spending time with my friends & family.

## Past Coding Experience

I have not had any coding experience prior to this course, but I am eager to learn.  Growing up I watched my dad code for work and for fun, so I have had some exposure to how lines of code can be displayed, but never actually worked on it myself until creating this assignment.

## Career Goals

My goal is to specialize in web design for my career.  I'd like to have a solid knowledge of graphic design, UX theory, and coding as I enter the workforce. I hope to use my passion for design and aesthetics to help others execute their professional ideas.
